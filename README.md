# Morphemes in Turkish 

## Brief history

In the early 19th century, The hypothesis of Ural-Altaic language family was an effort to associate different languages with each other through some similarities. The accepted idea today is that there is a common ancestry between the languages listed in this family [1]. For example; Japanese and Korean are geographically close to each other but Turkic languages are closer to Korean than Japanese in linguistic similarity. For this reason, Korean and Turkic languages were accepted as an Altaic branch in the old theory[2]. Many of these languages are now being studied as isolated languages.
